~~~ How to Use ~~~
App begins with feed. If you want to post a picture or video of the event
you are currently attending, swipe left, and a camera screen will appear.


The good:
- Users, without and account, can anonymously add event pictures with
a description and coordinate location.


The Bad:
- What if a host of a house/ private party does not want their event to be
made public?
- What if the app begins to be used/ abused for nonevents? How can we avoid
"trolls"?
