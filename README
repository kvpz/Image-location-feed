About Eris (former app name. Nothing at this point.)

~~~ How to Use ~~~
App begins with feed. If you want to post a picture or video of the event
you are currently attending, swipe left, and a camera screen will appear.


Good things about the app from user perspective:
- Users, without and account, can anonymously add event pictures with
a description and coordinate location.

Bad things about the app from user perspective:
- What if a host of a house/ private party does not want their event to be
made public?
- What if the app begins to be used/ abused for nonevents? How can we avoid
"trolls"?

On January 28, 2017, Parse, the core API this app was originally based on, will cease
to exist. Amazon Web Services(AWS) will be hosting a webinar on Tuesday, March 1, 2016 at 2-3pm ET that will 
walk through the step required to migrate Parse mobile apps to AWS. I have class in this exact time 
frame, but will hopefully be permitted to miss so I can begin the migration to AWS services. 

Any help would be appreciated. Contact me.
